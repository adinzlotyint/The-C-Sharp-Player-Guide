# C# Player Guide - Quest Repository

Welcome to my repository, where I will be storing the tasks and projects (referred to as "quests") that are part of *The C# Player's Guide* - 5th edition. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions and implementations of the quests outlined in the book, allowing me to track my learning progress and share it with others.

## Overview

The quests included here range from basic C# programming exercises to more complex projects, covering various aspects of C# development. Each quest is an opportunity to practice and apply the knowledge gained from the book, helping to solidify core programming concepts and sharpen coding skills. 

The C# Player's Guide focuses on the following key areas:
- C# Basics and Syntax
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Advanced C# Features
- Error Handling and Debugging
- Collections and Data Structures

## Adding New Quests and Running a Specific Quest

New quests will be added progressively as I complete them. Each quest is stored in the `Quests` folder.

In order to run a specific quest, simply modify the `Main.cs` file and edit the line responsible for calling the class (Quest) method.
